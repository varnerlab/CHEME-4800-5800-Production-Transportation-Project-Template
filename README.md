# CHEME 4/5800 Minimum-cost Production Transportation Project
Template repository for the 4/5800 Minimum-cost Production and Transportation Problem project.

## Description
Imagine that we have a set of finished goods, each of which must be supplied to customers at some rate (customer demand). We can manufacture these goods at one or more production facilities (each plant has a supply constraint for goods it can manufacture), each manufacturing facility must source and ship raw materials, and finished goods are transported from the manufacturing site to the customer site. 
* Develop a program that computes minimum cost production and transportation plan that satisfies customer demand and supply constraints. This problem could be posed as a minimum-cost flow problem that can be solved using linear programming. 
* Youâ€™ll need to formulate a model that includes supply and demand constraints and transportation costs (edge costs) and interfaces with a linear programming solver to estimate an optimal solution. 
* What is the dual problem, and what does it describe in this case?
